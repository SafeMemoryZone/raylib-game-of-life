# Game of Life built with Raylib

This is my first time making any kind of game.
The goal of the project was to learn the basics of raylib
and how basic games are programmed. 

## Quick start

### Build the game

```console
$ mkdir out && cd out
```
```console
$ cmake .. && make
```

### Run the game
```console
$ cd src && ./raylib-game-of-life  
```
