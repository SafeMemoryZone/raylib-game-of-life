# Game of Life built with Raylib

## How to build the project
Make sure you have `cmake` installed on your system.
- Create a build dir in the root folder and `cd build`.
- Run `cmake .. && make` (you can also use a different build system instead of make).
- `cd src` and run the `raylib-game-of-life` executable.
