# Game of Life built with Raylib

This is my first time making any kind of game.
The goal of the project was to learn the basics of raylib
and how basic games are programmed. 

## Controls

- `SPACE` to pause/unpause the simulation.
- `RIGHT` or `LEFT` arrow to speed up/slow down time.
- `WASD` to move camera.
- `Mouse wheel scroll` to zoom in/out.
- `C` to clear and pause game.
- `RIGHT` or `LEFT` mouse button click to insert/delete cell.

## Quick start

### Build the game

```console
$ mkdir out && cd out
```
```console
$ cmake .. && make
```

### Run the game
```console
$ cd src && ./raylib-game-of-life  
```
